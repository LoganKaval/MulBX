# Jaiyk
   This is a Formerly NixOS Based Linux Distrobution.
This is a Script to Turn Debian GNU/Linux into Jaiyk.
When Running the Script You Have to be in a User Account that is NOT root!
The Distro is Pronounced Jay-ik.
Jaiyk Does NOT Include Snap Packages or the Snap Package Manager.
The Package Manager Nala CAN be Installed in the Installer!!! (For Debian)
The Nix Package Manager CAN be Installed in the Installer too. (For Arch and Debian)
Both Managers Are NOT Installed in the Madatory Section and Are Asked After the Desktop Envirment Options.
After Installation the Jaiyk Directory Can be Deleted From the User's Home Directory.
If You Added to the Code Please Add Your Name in The "credits.txt" File, Unless You Don't Want Credit.

Jaiyk Does Work On Linux Mint!
It Also Works on Ubuntu; the Linux Distro Linux Mint is Based Off of.
MX Linux Also Works is Very Simular to Linux Mint and Ubuntu.


# What's New?

   In Jaiyk 3.9.0-3.9.9 Code Named Nehir, a Few Key Improvements Have Been Made.
The First Improvement is Backups of the Old Configuration Files. 
The Directory "/etc/Jaiyk/bac-files/old" is Where the Configuration Files Are Kept in.
Some Files That Might be Backed Up is the BashRC, River, and Waybar Configuration Files. 
The New Configurations are Also Backed Up!
The "/etc/Jaiyk/bac-files" Directory is Where Those Files Are Stored.
For the Second Improvement, as we Hinted, we Have Switched to Wayland! 
We Are Now Using River for the Window Manager and Waybar for the Panel.
The New Alias "alaz" is a Quicker to Type Version of Pacman. 
This Obviously Only Works Properly on Arch and Arch Based Distributions.
